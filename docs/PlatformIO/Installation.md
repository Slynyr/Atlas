# Installation
## PlatformIO
PlatformIO is an open-source ecosystem for embedded development that supports various MCUs such as the ESP32 and the Arduino. All the information you need to install PlatformIO can be found [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#installation).

## Serial Monitor 
While PlatformIO does provide a built in serial monitor, there is a far better extension available made by Microsoft which has additional features you may want to use. Any references in Atlas to the serial monitor are reffering to the Microsoft extension and not the built in PlatformIO serial monitor. The extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor).
