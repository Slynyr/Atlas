## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a online forum where programmers can share and ask questions about different programming challenges they experience. If you're facing a programming issue, chances are someone on stack overflow has already experienced the same exact thing. If that's not the case and there is no solutions for your unique problem, there is nothing stopping you from creating your own thread.

Similarly to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Electronic Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) is an online forum where people working with electronics and hardware can ask questions about different challenges they experience. It can be very useful when experiencing issues with complex hardware.
