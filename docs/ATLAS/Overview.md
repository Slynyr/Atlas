# Overview

Atlas is an open-source resource designed to allow students in the TEJ 3M/4M curriculum to explore, learn, and develop programming skills for ESP32 microcontrollers using the PlatformIO development framework. Atlas is comprised of 4 chapters, each of which have been carefully constructed in a way that should be easily approachable to students which may be new to different concepts. 

If you are new to PlatformIO, it is highly recommended that you start with that chapter before moving onto the labs or the programming sections. The labs range in difficulty, each of which are designed to independently introduce you to new concepts which can later be applied in your future projects. For those interested in enhancing their programming skills when working with microcontrollers, the programming chapters offer some valuable tips and techniques.
